IBM Data Science Capstone Project
📌 Overview
This repository contains my Capstone Project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
The project applies various data science and machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem — predicting the success category of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch.

🎯 Objectives
Collect and preprocess data from multiple sources (SpaceX API, web scraping, and datasets).

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Use interactive visualizations with folium and plotly.

Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict outcomes.

Deploy findings and insights in a clear, reproducible format.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Folium, Plotly

Data Sources: SpaceX API, Wikipedia

📊 Key Insights
Historical data reveals a trend in improving Falcon 9 success rates.

Landing outcomes depend on launch site, payload mass, and booster version.

Machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM) achieved XX% accuracy in predicting launch success.
